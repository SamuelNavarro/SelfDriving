	One of the problems I encounter it was that there where frames when you find the the fited line is not on the lane. Because of that I new that i needed some kind of average. I don't know if a simply avg or something like EWMA.



	Another problem I saw was the fact that the frames could be from different sizes. At the beginning I hardcoded the variable $y\_fin$ so it can be roughly at the middle of the image. But when I started to work on the challenge video, I notice that the frames where different and in a real life scenario they will vary between videos. So I divided the frame.
