# Finding Lane Lines on the Road

## Project Structure

You can run the exercises both in Python and C++. 

### Python Code
You can have a look at the Jupyter Notebook inside the Python folder.


### C++ Code
Because I'm currently learning C++ and the fact that you can implement OpenCV code in C++, this was a great opportunity to make the implementation both in Python and C++.

#### Building C++ code:
1. `cd cpp`
2. `mkdir build && cd build`
3. `cmake ..`
4. `make`
Now you run the executables:
5. `./video ../../test_videos/challenge.mp4`
