One of the thins I believed I could make different was to make a moving window to detect the lines. I believed that you can make a mask of the image in places where you got peaks in your histogram.

But, this approach could be more computationally expensive because you have to use `cv2.fitPoly`. The fact that the parameters of `cv2.rectangle` are just two points makes it easy also to draw the rectangles.
